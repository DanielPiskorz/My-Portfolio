                <p id="p10">as far as I can remember (from 6 years old)</p>
                
                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                        <a href="#projects" class="btn btn-outline-warning">skip to projects</a>
                        
                        <div id="history">
                            
                                <p>At 6 y.o. I asked my parents for a radio control car model for Christmas. It was excellent fun to drive, but I couldn't stop wondering: how does it work?
                                        When my origins were absent I took a screwdriver from father's toolbox and dismantled my toy. Completly. Unfortunately I didn't know how to put it all back together.</p>
                                
                                <p> When I was 7, my parents brought acquainted specialist to repair a broken computer. Amused by his work I was the only one to sit with the geek 4 hours straight, watching him repairing a big white monster.
                                
                                <p>Being 8, I started my first business. I was selling carrots which my class was getting for free. I collected unwanted vegetables from my classmates to sell it later to kids from classes that weren't qualified for the program.  I saw what others didn't, and made my first money that way.
                                Although the "enterprise" was shut down by a teacher the next day,  that experience had taught me to always look wider than you're expected to.</p>
                                
                                <p>A year later, at 9, as I got access to the internet - 15 mins a day (it was still expensive, or at least my parents told me so) I started playing with HTML. I made my first website (ugly but working!). I didn't understand English yet, so after completing Polish tutorials I gave it up for some time, and gaming took over.</p>
                                
                                <p>In 2014 I volunteered to run a church site. I've been doing it for almost two years, learning to comply with given requirements.</p>
                                
                                <p>Then I've switched to something different. I was running a digital business selling virtual CS:GO weapons skins in packages on Allegro, I made more than twice of invested money and beat all the competition (there's also an interesting story about it, but a bit long and not relevant to programming).</p>
                                
                                <p>Being excited about joinery I've decided to found a workshop from earned money. Planning and creating things from wood was oddly satisfying, but I wanted to take it further.</p>
                                
                                <p>I bought Arduino, with a lot of different things to play with. I learned the basics of electronics and programming in C and created a few interesting projects. I loved the adventure, all the same, I hated the fact that physical hardware (so expensive for me then) was limiting my possibilities.</p>
                                
                                <p> That was the moment I decided to go into pure computer programming. I switched from C to C++ in order to learn objective programming, and after a short period of time decided to stay with Java due to its possibilities with both Android and big enterprise applications. </p>
                                
                                <p>I've been making a lot of small programs in core Java describing real-world processes, and passed OCAJP 8 exam in Cracow, in May 2017.</p>
                                <p>A few months later I pursuit to make my childhood dream come true, and created my own high-end Android game. I've programmed it with UnityScript and C#.</p>
